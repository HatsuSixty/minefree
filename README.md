# minefree

Crack `Minecraft: Bedrock Edition` with just one click.

## Quick Start

In order to compile this, you will need to have the `mingw-w64` toolchain installed under Linux.

```console
$ make
```

Now, you can run `minefree.exe`, and it will automatically replace `C:\Windows\System32\Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` with the modified one, effectively tricking Windows into thinking you own Minecraft.

## Precompiled binary

Coming soon...
